## Introduction

This project implements a Gradle plugin that extracts DDL from an Android Room SQLite database schema file. It is intended to be declared as a build script dependency in the project-level `build.gradle` file of an Android project, included as a plugin in the `app`- or `library`-module-level `build.gradle` file, and configured in the latter `build.gradle`, as well. 

## Latest version

1.0.0

## Requirements

* Tested with database schema files generated by Room 2.x. (It may work with Room 1.x-generated schema files, but you're on your own there.)

* Compiled with JDK 11; thus, any projects using this plugin must be running Gradle with JDK 11 or higher. (Note that the Android Gradle plugin v7.x has the same requirement.)
